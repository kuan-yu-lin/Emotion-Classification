##Project Information

### Description

With the gaining popularity of emotion classification, the following project deals with different approaches of implementing emotion classification. The ISEAR dataset, which includes scenarios regarding seven emotion, joy, anger, fear, shame, disgust, guilt and sadness, was used in this project. We implemented single layer perceptron, BERT with three different inputs and a Multi-layer perceptron that combines maching learning and lexicon-based approaches in our project. 

### Dataset
